#Random Number Game
A quick game that generates a number between 1 and 20 and asks you to guess. Checks that your input is a digit, and provides guidance if you guess too high or low. Created this while working through the list of beginner Python projects on the [Knight Lab site](https://knightlab.northwestern.edu/2014/06/05/five-mini-programming-projects-for-the-python-beginner/)
